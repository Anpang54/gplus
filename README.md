# G<sup>+</sup>
A new open-source multi-paradigm programming language.

The repository is private for now, and it's named "gplus" because Github doesn't allow plusses, even more superscript plusses in names, as it ironically changes plusses to a minus.

G<sup>+</sup> actually has 2 versions: G<sup>+</sup> which is coded in C and runs offline, and G<sup>web</sup> which is coded in client JS and runs on the web.

You might've noticed that this repository doesn't have an issues page, that's because all of it is on the discord server.\
So, [**join the discord server!**](https://discord.gg/Th4KGqSRpU) You'll be able to report bugs, give suggestions, get coding help, and see new update leaks.
