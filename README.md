# Disclaimer - This project ended!
Me (Anpang54) and Pique decided to stop making this as a collab, as we couldn't read each other's code.

I forked from this as [Pineapple](https://github.com/Anpang54/pineapple), and Pique forked as G#. Feel free to fork from Pineapple and make your own changes (they'll be merged and you'll be credited). As for Pique's C#, he's probably making it closed-source.

This repo is now a public archive, and the Discord server was already "archived" for a month or so. I'm keeping the organization name (`gplus-lang`) just in case anyone tries to steal it.

# G<sup>+</sup>
A new open-source multi-paradigm programming language.

The repository is private for now, and it's named "gplus" because Github doesn't allow plusses, even more superscript plusses in names, as it ironically changes plusses to a minus.

G<sup>+</sup> actually has 2 versions: G<sup>+</sup> which is coded in C and runs offline, and G<sup>web</sup> which is coded in client JS and runs on the web.

### Discord server
You might've noticed that this repository doesn't have an issues page, that's because all of it is on the discord server.\
So, [**join the discord server!**](https://discord.gg/Cn7hsgzusN) You'll be able to report bugs, give suggestions, get coding help, and see new update leaks.

### Donations
[**Buy us a coffee!**](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/gplus) It's only $5 or around 170à¸¿.

Donations help support the project and pay for yearly domain costs.

We hope you have fun with G<sup>+</sup>!
